# Flappy Elon

A standalone browser game where you pilot a pixellated Elon Musk through an endless field of pipes. The entire project lives inside the `flappy-elon/` directory.

## Play It

1. Open `flappy-elon/index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
2. Tap/click or press **Space** to flap.
3. Dodge the pipes, chase new high scores, and laugh at the crash quotes.

### Highlights

- Four selectable difficulty presets (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Elon Mode) with distinct pipe speeds and spacing
- Per-mode high score tracking with a quick-look scoreboard for every mode
- Smoother, physics-inspired movement with polished pipe/ground art
- Chill retro background loop with crunchy crash feedback
- Elon Mode unleashes a ludicrous-speed gauntlet for thrill seekers
- Responsive layout tuned for both desktop and mobile play
